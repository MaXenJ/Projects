This is my portfolio as an amateur JS developer. Hope you will enjoy looking at my progress becoming a real developer from the scratch.
It took me a little more than half a year to learn the CSS (Bootstrap, Grid, Flex)(Prefer using Grid and flex to Bootstrap), HTML5, and
finally JavaScript! 
Now on my way to become a real Developer soon! 
Learning Node.js and ReactJS!
